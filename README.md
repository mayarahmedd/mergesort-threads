Merge Sort
Merge sort is an O (n log n) comparison-based sorting algorithm. It is a divide and
conquers algorithm. Conceptually, a merge sort works as follows:
If the list is of length 0 or 1, then it is already sorted. Otherwise:
1. Divide the unsorted list into two sub-lists of about half the size.
2. Sort each sub-list recursively by re-applying the merge sort.
3. Merge the two sub-lists back into one sorted list
So you are required to implement it using pthreads. Each time the list is divided; two
threads are created to do merge-sort on each half separately. This step is repeated
recursively until each sub-list has only one element.
The program should read two input matrices from a file in the following format:

[number of elements]
Array elements which are space separated.

example input:

Assignment 2 - pthreads 3
10
100 20 15 3 4 8 7 -1 0 33

When the program finishes, it should print out the sorted array.

ðŸ’¡ Please note that in both cases your program should take the name of
the input file as an argument
